  # include

  Include sections of content you would like to repeat across the website. The optional *with* clause lets you specify a value which is bound to the snippet's name within the snippet's context.

      {% raw %}{% include 'footer' %}
      {% include 'sidebar' with foo: 'bar' %}
      {% include 'product_information' with product %}{% endraw %}

  The snippets are declared in the `app/views/snippets` directory, the snippet slug is the filename.
