  # editable\_short\_text

  Editable areas contain content you want a user to be able to change. The content within the tag will be the default one.

  In the back-office, the editable element will be found under the tab corresponding to the block wrapping it. It is possible to associate the element to another block.

  The input field in the back-office used to edit the content is a *short-size textarea,* without the ability to insert new paragraphs for instance.

  An element can be inherited by children, each page keeping its own version of the content. However, in some cases, it may be a requirement to have the element to be editable in one place. If so, just set the "fixed" option to true.

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    You must give these sections a unique name because they will be inherited by children.
  </div>
