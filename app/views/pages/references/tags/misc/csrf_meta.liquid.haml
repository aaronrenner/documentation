  # csrf_meta

  The *csrf_meta* tag gives the information the javascript code has to include for each AJAX POST request in order to prevent *Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)* attacks.

      {% raw %}<html>
        <head>
        {% csrf_meta %}
        </head>
        ...
      </html>
  {% endraw %}

  By default, that protection is *disabled* in order to keep backwards compatibility with the existing public forms.

  If you want to enable it, open your *config/initializers/locomotive.rb* file and toggle the csrf property on.

      config.csrf_protection = true
