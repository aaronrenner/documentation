  # csrf_param

  Forms inside the Liquid templates, such as a contact form for instance, can be protected from *Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)* attacks.

      {% raw %}<form action="/contact">
      {% csrf_param %}
      ...
      </form>
  {% endraw %}

  By default, that protection is *disabled* in order to keep backwards compatibility with the existing public forms.

  If you want to enable it, open your *config/initializers/locomotive.rb* file and toggle the csrf property on.

      config.csrf_protection = true

  <div class="alert alert-info">
  For <b>AJAX</b> requests, please consider the <a href="/references/tags/misc/csrf_meta">csrf_meta</a> tag.
  </div>
