  LocomotiveCMS contains two components:

  - **Wagon** is a command line tool that makes it easy to develop locally. It embeds a small http server and some generators.
  - the **engine** is a Rails engine, you will use it to run a LocomotiveCMS site, it embeds all the administration user interface. We will provide LocomotiveCMS hosting soon: you only need this component if you want to host your site with your own solution.

  ## Requirements for both the Engine and Wagon

  <strong>Unfortunately, we do not officially support Windows</strong>... yet. We're working on it, for the moment our advice would be to run a Linux virtual machine (using Virtual Box and Vagrant for exemple).
  <br/>
  This being said, you can find some cool posts about Windows installation recipes, like <a href="http://shoobm.wordpress.com/2013/01/27/installing-locomotive-cms-on-windows-7/" target="_blank">this shoobm's article</a>.

  # Ruby

  For performance concerns, we only support the last version of Ruby meaning the 1.9.3.

  Ruby can be installed by following the instructions here: [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads)

  However, we recommend people to install a Ruby version management system, such as [RBENV](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/)

  <div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>For OS X Lion users,</strong> there are conflicts between RVM and MacPorts causing weird <strong>Segmentation Fault</strong> bugs. Everything is explained in this <strong><a href="http://www.seqmedia.com/2012/05/08/frustrations-abound-rvm-vs-macports-and-the-bug-segmentation-fault/">post</a></strong>
  </div>

  # ImageMagick

  Our CMS takes benefits of ImageMagick to crop images on the fly. Again, [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) is available on a large set of OS.

  <div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> on Mac OS X, try <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> or <a href="https://github.com/maddox/magick-installer">MagickInstaller</a> to install it. This will save you a couple of hours because its installation can be really painful sometimes.

  ## Requirements only for the Engine

  # Ruby on Rails

  Our CMS is a [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) engine which allows you to wrap it into your main application. Ruby on Rails supports engines since its 3.0 version but in order to enjoy the full power of it, you have to install the last version which is **3.2.x**

  Once you get Ruby installed, install Ruby on Rails with the following command:

      gem install rails --version=3.2.11

  # MongoDB

  LocomotiveCMS does not use a classic SQL database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL but rather a nosql database named mongoDB. Because we let users create their own content types, it occurred to us that using a schema-free database was the perfect fit.

  We support versions above **2.0.0** (the current stable version is 2.2.2).

  MongoDB is available on many OS. Check this [link out](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) for more information.

  # Browsers (back-office)

  For both practical and ideological reasons, we decided to support only <strong>Firefox, Safari and Google Chrome.</strong> But, it should not be so tough to override the default stylesheets in order to offer a different but working version of Internet Explorer.

  <div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Done?</strong> You can now <a href="install-wagon">install Wagon</a>.
  </div>
